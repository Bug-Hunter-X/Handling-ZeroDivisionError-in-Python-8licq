This repository demonstrates a common Python error: ZeroDivisionError and showcases its solution. The bug.py file contains code that raises this error, while bugSolution.py provides the corrected code. The error arises when attempting to divide by zero, which is mathematically undefined. The solution involves adding an if statement to check if the divisor is zero before the division operation is performed. If the divisor is zero, an appropriate action is taken, such as returning a specific value or raising a different exception.
